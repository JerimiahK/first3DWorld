## Description
This is a sandbox application for exploring the AFrame framework and its capabilities. It is a framework that uses Three.js as its rendering engine and can call to its API to use built in Three.js methods. This repo is free to clone for anyone who is wants to clone and immediately be able to sandbox with AFrame. It features a landscape, donut, and animated soldier model, the latter models have animated properties that can be controlled via the animation-mixer prop.


## Usage
To use this application, you can clone the repo into a folder on your local machine. When you open in your IDE run an ###'npm i' to install of the necessary packages to be able to run the application. Use ###'npm start' to run a live development server, and you will be redirected to your browser. Your camera will spawn in the middle of the donut, so use either the arrow keys, or 'WASD' to move the camera around the landscape. Have fun and if you do anything cool, I want to see it! :)
